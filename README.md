Automation and Supervision Based Siemens PLC of The Electro Chlorination Station with Seawater Intake Facility in Ras Djinet Power Plant
This project presents an integrated automation and supervision solution for the electro-
chlorination station and the seawater intake facility at the Ras-Djinet Combined Cycle Power
Plant, operated by Sonelgaz. Previously, these two facilities were operated independently
using separate Allen-Bradley PLC systems.
To address these issues, the project migrates both systems to a unified Siemens SIMATIC
platform using S7-300 PLCs and the TIA Portal, with WinCC for HMI, and is validated
through simulation using Factory I/O and PLCSIM, laying the groundwork for future scal-
ability
